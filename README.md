### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Siddharth from India, and I am a Java developer. A final year undergraduate student currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering at VIT, Vellore, I enjoy learning backend frameworks and simultaneously work/research on Search Engine Optimisation (SEO). Hardworking, diligent and methodical, I put forward my 100%
when I pursue something. A fast learner and an intent listener, I feel innovation is an integral part of day to day advancements in technology and sustained communication is the key to success.
